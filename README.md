Run the game

1) The directory hosting index.html should have three
subdirectories:
  a) \css <--contains all css files
  b) \images <--contains all image files
  c) \js <--contains all javascript files

2) Open index.html with your browser (which may be the
default program).


Play the game
-------------
1) Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move
the player to the water while avoiding bugs.

2) If you reach the water, your score increases by one.
If you run into a bug, your score decreases by one.

3) If you get any gems or other bonus objects before you
reach the water, you receive potential bonus points.

4) Bonus points only count towards your score if you
collect the bonus and reach the water before a bug gets
you.

5) If a bug gets you before reaching the water, you lose
any bonus points collected that turn.
